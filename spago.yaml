  # Optional section for configuring the `spago publish` command.
  # If you intend to publish your package, this section becomes mandatory.
  publish:
    # The version of your package. This follows semver rules, but with no
    # prereleases - so only major.minor.patch.
    version: 0.2.1
    # The license for your source, in SPDX format: https://spdx.dev/
    license: MPL-2.0
    # Optional list of globs to include in the published archive, in
    # addition to the list of files that the Registry includes by default:
    # https://github.com/purescript/registry-dev/blob/master/SPEC.md#always-included-files
    #include:
    #- "test/**/*.purs"
    # Optional list of globs to exclude from the published archive, in
    # addition to the list of files that the Registry includes by default:
    # https://github.com/purescript/registry-dev/blob/master/SPEC.md#always-excluded-files
    # Note that the Registry will first apply the `include` list, then
    # the `exclude` one, as detailed in the specification:
    # https://github.com/purescript/registry-dev/blob/master/SPEC.md#33-manifest
    exclude:
      - "test/graphs/**/*"
      # The place where the Registry will fetch the source from.
      # This is optional since you might want to release the code without
      # publishing to the Registry, which is what this is needed for.
